## What are tokens?
## What are Ethereum tokens?
In simple terms, Ethereum tokens are digital assets that build upon Ethereum's smart contract platform. Via existing blockchain infrastructure, they enable developers to build new ecosystems and use-cases without developing entirely new blockchains. Ethereum tokens are essentially smart contracts (or collections of these contracts) that can represent digital assets.

These tokens can have a wide variety of functions, including, but not limited to:

- Currencies for platform-specific usage
- Representations of physical or digital objects
- Governance tokens for autonomous regulation

Usually, transacting with these tokens requires you to conduct an Ethereum transaction which requires Ethereum GAS to execute on the blockchain. And, like traditional economics, the supply and demand of these digital assets determines their relative valuation.
